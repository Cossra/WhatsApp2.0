A **production-grade real-time messaging and video calling app** inspired by WhatsApp. Built with **Next.js 15**, **TypeScript**, **Convex**, and **Stream APIs**, featuring secure authentication, optimized performance, and scalable architecture.

## 🚀 Quick Start

> ⚠️ **Requirements:**  
> Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) 18+, [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/), and a [Convex](https://www.convex.dev/) account set up.

---

### **Run It Immediately**

Once everything is installed, **you must run two commands in separate terminals** to launch the app:

| Terminal | Command         | Purpose               |
|-----------|----------------|-----------------------|
| **1**     | `npx convex dev` | Runs the Convex backend (real-time database & functions) |
| **2**     | `pnpm run dev`   | Runs the Next.js frontend on `http://localhost:3000` |

> ⚡ **Important:**  
> Keep both terminals running at the same time for the app to function properly.

## 🌟 Final Notes

This project was built to **showcase my skills as a full-stack developer** and demonstrate how cutting-edge tech stacks can come together to build something both **practical and scalable**.

I wanted to go beyond just another "clone" by integrating:
- **Real-time database operations**  
- **Secure authentication flows**  
- **Video conferencing capabilities**  
- **A polished, production-grade user experience**

If you're checking out the repo, take it for a spin — send a few messages, create a group chat, hop on a video call.  
Who knows? You might even find yourself using it like a real app. 😎

> Enjoy building, exploring, and tinkering with the code.  
> If you have ideas or feedback, don't be shy — open an issue or drop me a message!
